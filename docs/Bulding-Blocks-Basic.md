# Implementing DDD Building Blocks with Scala Constructs

## Overview: Mapping Scala Constructs to DDD Building Blocks

| DDD Building Block | Primary Scala Constructs                         | Key Characteristics                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Value Objects**  | Value Classes, Case Classes, Opaque Types, Enums | Immutable, equality by value, no identity                |
| **Entities**       | Classes with private constructors, Case Classes  | Mutable state, identity-based equality                   |
| **Aggregates**     | Classes with private constructors, Traits        | Encapsulation, invariant enforcement, controlled access  |


## 1. Classes

- Pattern: Private Constructor + Companion Object Factory
- Best Practice: Always use private constructors with companion object factory methods to enforce invariants and control object creation

### When to Use Classes
- **Entities**: Objects with identity that may change state over time
- **Aggregates**: Complex objects that encapsulate multiple entities and value objects
- **Domain Services**: Stateless services that orchestrate domain operations

## 2. Value Classes

- Pattern: Value Class with Smart Constructor
- Best Practice: Use value classes for single-value wrappers to avoid runtime overhead while maintaining type safety
- Limitations and Considerations: cannot be nested, extended, or have multiple parameters

### When to Use Value Classes
- **Simple Value Objects**: Single-value wrappers (IDs, measurements, codes)
- **Performance-critical contexts**: Where you need type safety without runtime overhead
- **Primitive obsession elimination**: Replace raw strings/ints with meaningful types

## 3. Algebraic Data Types (ADTs)

- Pattern: Sealed Traits with Case Classes
- Best Practice: Use sealed traits to create exhaustive type hierarchies that make illegal states unrepresentable
- Advanced ADT Pattern: State Machines

### When to Use ADTs
- **Complex Value Objects**: Objects with multiple valid variants
- **State machines**: Objects that transition between well-defined states
- **Domain modeling**: Representing business concepts with multiple forms
- **Error handling**: Representing success/failure scenarios

## 4. Enums for Simple Domain Classifications

- Pattern: Enum with Methods and Validation
- Best Practice: Use enums for simple, closed sets of values with associated behavior

### When to Use Enums
- **Simple classifications**: Closed set of related values
- **Configuration options**: Predefined choices with associated behavior
- **State representation**: Simple state machines without complex transitions
- **Type-safe constants**: Replacing string/int constants with type-safe alternatives

## Summary: Choosing the Right Construct

| Use Case                    | Recommended Construct                   | Key Benefits                              |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Simple Value Objects**    | Value Classes, Opaque Types             | Performance, type safety                  |
| **Complex Value Objects**   | Case Classes with private constructors  | Immutability, validation                  |
| **Entities**                | Classes with private constructors       | Identity, mutable state, encapsulation    |
| **Aggregates**              | Classes with private constructors       | Invariant enforcement, controlled access  |
| **Domain Classifications**  | Enums                                   | Type safety, exhaustive matching          |
| **Complex Domain Types**    | Sealed Traits + Case Classes            | Flexibility, compile-time guarantees      |

### Universal Patterns
1. **Always use private constructors** with companion object factory methods
2. **Validate at construction time** to maintain invariants
3. **Return `Either[Error, T]`** (or equivalent) from factory methods for explicit error handling
4. **Use immutable data structures** where possible
5. **Leverage the type system** to make illegal states unrepresentable
